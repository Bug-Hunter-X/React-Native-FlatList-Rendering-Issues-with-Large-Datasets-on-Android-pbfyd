# React Native FlatList Rendering Bug on Android

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using `FlatList` in React Native with large datasets, especially on Android devices. The bug leads to inconsistent rendering, missing items, or incorrect item order.

## Problem

The primary issue stems from inefficient key generation or incorrect usage of the `keyExtractor` prop within the `FlatList`.  This causes React Native's reconciliation process to struggle, resulting in performance degradation and inaccurate rendering of list items. The problem is exacerbated when dealing with complex item rendering logic.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing a robust and efficient `keyExtractor` function that guarantees unique keys for each item in the dataset. This ensures React Native correctly identifies and updates the necessary items during rendering.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app on an Android emulator or device.
4. Observe the inconsistent rendering of the list items.
