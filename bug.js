This React Native bug arises when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex item rendering logic.  The issue manifests as inconsistent rendering, where some items are missing or appear in the wrong order, especially after scrolling or re-rendering. This is often due to inefficient key generation or improper usage of `keyExtractor` prop, leading to React Native's internal reconciliation process getting confused and not properly updating the list items. The symptom is visible on Android devices, especially on lower-end models.
